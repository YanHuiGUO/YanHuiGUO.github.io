abstract = {We propose a novel deep multi-modality neural network for restoring very low bit rate videos of talking heads. Such video contents are very common in social media, teleconferencing, distance education, tele-medicine, etc., and often need to be transmitted with limited bandwidth. The proposed CNN method exploits the correlations among three modalities, video, audio and emotion state of the speaker, to remove the video compression artifacts caused by spatial down sampling and quantization. The deep learning approach turns out to be ideally suited for the video restoration task, as the complex non-linear cross-modality correlations are very difficult to model analytically and explicitly. The new method is a video post processor that can significantly boost the perceptual quality of aggressively compressed talking head videos, while being fully compatible with all existing video compression standards.},
